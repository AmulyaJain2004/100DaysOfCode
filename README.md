# 100 Days of Code

Welcome to the **100 Days of Code** challenge! This repository is dedicated to helping you master Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA) and programming through consistent daily practice and projects or or exploring any area of coding.

## üìÖ Challenge Overview

Welcome to the **100 Days of Code Challenge** repository! This is a place where we commit to improving our coding skills by coding for at least an hour every day for the next 100 days. Whether you're learning Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA), diving into new programming languages, or exploring any area of coding, this challenge is for you!

## üìö What You'll Learn

Throughout this challenge, you will:
- Develop a solid understanding of fundamental data structures (arrays, linked lists, stacks, queues, trees, graphs, etc.)
- Master essential algorithms (sorting, searching, dynamic programming, etc.)
- Enhance your problem-solving skills by tackling various coding challenges
- Work on real-world projects to apply your knowledge
- Become proficient in your preferred programming language (Python, C, C++, Java, Go, Rust, JavaScript etc.)
